# Hi, I'm Gina White 👋  
**Data Analyst | Spreadsheet Whisperer | Project Juggler Extraordinaire**

### 💼 What I'm All About
I'm a data analyst with a deep love for clean spreadsheets, SQL puzzles, and bringing order to chaos — whether that's in a database, a dashboard, or a multi-departmental project. I have years of experience in operations and team coordination, and recently, I’ve been diving deeper into SQL while working full time and running a creative design gig on the side.

### 🔍 Currently Working On:
- Expanding my SQL skills through real-world data projects
- Building a public portfolio right here on GitHub
- Creating beautiful layouts and visuals for an indie magazine
- Expanding my knowledge of Excel by creating dashboards (coming soon!)

### ⚙️ Skills & Tools
- **Excel** (I'm not saying we’re in love… but we’re close)
- **SQL** (growing more fluent daily!)
- **Google Workspace** (Forms, Sheets, Docs — I make them dance)
- **Tableau** (learning)
- **Jira & Scrum** (I speak Agile)
- **Adobe InDesign & Procreate** (for my design work)

### 🌿 A Few of My Favorite Things
When I’m not solving data problems, you’ll find me:
- Running trails 🏃‍♀️ or getting my hands dirty in clay or soil 🪴
- Taking photos of everything (especially plants)
- Hiking, reading, or learning design theory for fun
- Studying for my Master Gardener certification 🌱
